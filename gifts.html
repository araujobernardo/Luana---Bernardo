            <p>As you all know, we jumped the gun and moved in together before getting married. Oops! You probably also know that we prefer experiences over things.</p>
            
            <p>So instead of asking for blenders and cutlery, we created a more fun list of gifts with things we'll be doing on our honeymoon.</p>

            <p>The way it'll work, you can pick and choose from the list below. Then let us know what you are giving us. You can transfer the amount listed to our bank account (also listed below).</p>
            
            <p>Feel free to get together and share the most expensive items. You can even transfer only part of the money.</p>
            
            <p>We'll make sure to let you know when we get your gift and you will be forever remembered as the one who made it possible!</p>
