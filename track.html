            <p>We are so excited to have finally shared this plan with you, so as promised, here are further details you need to consider before making a decision to either join us or not.<br></p>
            <h4>The Track</h4>
            <p>Lake Wilson is a moderate tramping track and it’s one way and back through the same way. Our wedding ceremony will be up there by the lake. The track starts at the Routeburn Shelter Carpark. You will follow the Routeburn Track, passing the Routeburn Falls hut, then Lake Harris, and just before continuing  left to reach Harris Saddle Shelter, you will turn on a trail branching off to the right from the Routeburn Track. You will take about 4-5 hours to reach this point.</p>

            <p>Once you take the right off the Routeburn Track, you can immediately see you are no longer hiking on a Great Walk as the track gets narrower, it’s not as well-formed and well-maintained, and you will need to pay attention to find your way. This next section should take you about 2-2.5 hours.<br>
            It’s pretty straight forward, you only need to continue on the true right of the valley, following the track forward (as seen on the picture above). You will reach the headwaters of Lake Harris, and a beautiful little river, followed by a flat, swampy area called “Valley of the Trolls”. You just need to keep going straight on the true right of the valley until you reach the waterfall.<br>
            At that point, you cross the little river and start making your way up through the steep gully on the right hand side of the waterfall. This section can be a little tricky, so you must take care and go slowly. At the top of the gully, you will finally find your destination - the stunning Lake Wilson.<br>

            <h4>Track overview</h4>
            <p>Difficulty: Moderate (fitness & route finding skills required)<br>
            Times/length: 6-8 hours, 17Km one way.<br>
            Total ascent: 1360m.<br>
            Start location: Routeburn shelter carpark, located <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/fDpi2F8qbEz" target="_blank">HERE</a>.<br>
            Equipment: Check out the equipment list we created for you
            Weather: Always prepare for alpine weather in any season!<br>
            Facilities: There are no facilities at Lake Wilson - it’s a truly backcountry experience. This means there are no huts to sleep in, no rubbish bins, no toilets, and no filtered water (only the fresh and delicious water from the Lake itself). You will need to camp overnight, and carry all your supplies/rubbish with you and back.<br>
            Similar tracks: If you have done the Tongariro Crossing, this will give you an idea of the track formation, but imagine two days of the Tongariro Crossing, with a heavy backpack carrying all your supplies.
