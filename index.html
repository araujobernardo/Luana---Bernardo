                <p>You're invited to join us on our wedding adventure in our favourite place in the
                world: Lake Wilson - Mount Aspiring National Park. This is not your standard
                wedding! As you know, we are adventure lovers, and our wedding ceremony
                could not be any different.</p>
                <p>Lake Wilson is an alpine lake located just off the famous Routeburn Track. Our
                plan is to hike in together on Saturday morning (about 6-7 hours hike), have our
                wedding ceremony up there in the afternoon, camp overnight, and hike out on
                Sunday.</p>
                <p>We understand it can be hard to plan if you haven't done anything like this
                before. That's why we created this website and loaded all details to help you understand what our plan is, how the track works, and what you'll need to carry along. Now, based on these details and your fitness level, you can make your own judgement to decide if you're up for the challenge or not. Let us know if you have any questions along the way.</p>
                <p>We are also planning on doing a small and informal gathering in Christchurch
                and Auckland, so we can celebrate with those who can't join our adventure, so
                don't feel pressured if you don't think you can join us.
                We can't wait to share this new chapter of our lives with you!</p>
                <p class="noIndent">Lots of love,<br>
                Luana and Bernardo</p>
