            <p>You're invited to join us on our wedding adventure in our favourite place in the
                world: Lake Wilson - Mount Aspiring National Park. This is not your standard
                wedding! As you know, we are adventure lovers, and our wedding ceremony
                could not be any different.<br>
                Lake Wilson is an alpine lake located just off the famous Routeburn Track. Our
                plan is to hike in together on Saturday morning (about 6-7 hours hike), have our
                wedding ceremony up there in the afternoon, camp overnight, and hike out on
                Sunday.<br>
                We understand it can be hard to plan if you haven't done anything like this
                before. We will send through further details shortly so you can understand how
                the track works, check your fitness level, and get your equipment sorted, before
                deciding to join us or not.<br>
                We are also planning on doing a small and informal gathering in Christchurch
                and Auckland, so we can celebrate with those who can't join our adventure, so
                don't feel pressured if you don't think you can take up the challenge.
                We can't wait to share this new chapter of our lives with you!<br>
                Lots of love,<br>
                Luana and Bernardo</p>
