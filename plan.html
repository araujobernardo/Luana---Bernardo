            <h3>THE PLAN</h3>
            <p>Our plan is to start the hike early at around 6am on Saturday the 18th of February, so everyone can walk at their own pace, allowing plenty of time to arrive at Lake Wilson, set up the tents, and get ready for our ceremony at around 3pm.</p>

            <p>The ceremony will be very simple, but we are going to dress like bride and groom, don’t worry! We will also have a celebrant up there with us, and a videographer - yes, we managed to find wedding vendors just as crazy as us! You don't need to worry about carrying traditional wedding clothes, of course, just your hiking trousers/shorts, and a t-shirt will be perfect. We might ask you to wear a particular colour for the ceremony, but we will specify this closer to the date.</p>  

            <p>After the ceremony, we will have dinner together - probably a simple Backcountry freeze-dried meal. We'll share some stories, connect, and maybe play some card games before the sun goes down and we start to freeze. We will all sleep in our own tents, wake up the next morning to check out the sunrise (only if you’re up for it!), have breakfast together, pack up and hike back down to end the adventure.</p>
