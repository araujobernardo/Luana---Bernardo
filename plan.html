            <h3>THE PLAN</h3>
            <p>test test Our plan is to start the hike early at around 6am on Saturday the 18th of February, so everyone can walk at their own pace, allowing plenty of time to arrive at Lake Wilson, set up the tents, and get ready for our ceremony at around 3pm.</p>

            <p>The ceremony will be very simple, but we are going to dress like bride and groom, don’t worry! We will also have a celebrant up there with us, and a videographer - yes, we managed to find wedding vendors just as crazy as us! You don't need to worry about carrying traditional wedding clothes, of course, just your hiking trousers/shorts, and a t-shirt will be perfect. We might ask you to wear a particular colour for the ceremony, but we will specify this closer to the date.</p>  

            <p>After the ceremony, we will have dinner together - probably a simple Backcountry freeze-dried meal. We'll share some stories, connect, and maybe play some card games before the sun goes down and we start to freeze. We will all sleep in our own tents, wake up the next morning to check out the sunrise (only if you’re up for it!), have breakfast together, pack up and hike back down to end the adventure.</p>

            <p>Although we will pray for the sun gods, and even do a “sun dance” prior to the date, please note our plan is subject to the weather. In the unlikely event of dangerous weather warnings, we may need to go a couple of days earlier or later - we hope you can be a little flexible with your dates, but hopefully that won’t be the case. If the forecast is only looking drizzly, overcast, etc, but still safe to hike, we will go ahead on the planned dates. We will only change it if it’s dangerous to hike and we will give you an update a week prior to the wedding.</p> 

            <p class="noIndent">Date: Saturday 18 February - Sunday 19 February 2023<br>
            Time: Leave from the Routeburn Shelter at 6am<br>
            Dress code: Hiking clothes of course - even for the ceremony :)</p>
